**Platform:** Azure-hosted multi-tenant environment

### Before State
```
Current Compliance Status: No SOC 2 program
├── Authentication: Inconsistent across platform components
├── Incident Response: No formal procedures documented
├── Change Management: Ad-hoc approval processes
├── Vulnerability Management: No systematic scanning
└── Vendor Oversight: Minimal third-party assessments
```

**Key Risks:**
- Unable to pursue Fortune 500 clients without SOC 2 certification
- Authentication gaps across multi-tenant platform
- No documented incident response for customer-affecting events
- Regulatory compliance gaps for healthcare/finance prospects

### My Assessment Methodology
**Framework Applied:** SOC 2 Trust Service Criteria Analysis

**Step 1: Business Requirements Analysis**
- Evaluated 24x7 service model requirements

**Step 2: Trust Service Criteria Prioritization**
```
Trust Service Criteria Assessment:
Security        ■■■■■ (Required - All SOC 2 audits)
Availability    ■■■■■ (Critical - 24x7 service model)
Confidentiality ■■■■■ (Essential - Log data sensitivity)
Processing      ■■■□□ (Moderate - Standard data processing)
Privacy         ■■□□□ (Lower - Limited PII handling)
```

**Step 3: Gap Analysis & Control Development**
- Mapped current practices against TSC requirements
- Identified 15+ control gaps across prioritized criteria
- Developed 10 specific controls addressing critical gaps

### After State - Recommendations Implemented
