## Third-Party Risk Assessment

### Business Context
**Client:** Healthcare organization planning major cloud migration
**Challenge:** Assess $2.4M IaaS provider for 6-8 month platform migration
**Regulatory Requirements:** HIPAA compliance, US data residency, disaster recovery

### Before State - Risk Exposure
**Migration Challenges:**
```
Current Risk Profile:
├── Vendor Unknown: No security assessment completed
├── Regulatory Risk: HIPAA compliance status unclear
├── Data Residency: Geographic controls not verified
├── Integration Risk: Security control gaps unknown
└── Contract Risk: Security terms not negotiated
```

**Critical Requirements:**
- US-only data center locations (regulatory mandate)
- HIPAA Business Associate Agreement capability
- Encryption for PHI at rest and in transit
- 24x7 incident response with healthcare experience
- Disaster recovery with <4 hour RTO for critical systems

### My Assessment Methodology
**Framework Applied:** Third-Party Risk Management (TPRM) with Healthcare Focus

**Step 1: Requirements Definition**
- Documented client's specific regulatory and technical requirements
- Identified shared responsibility model boundaries
- Established security control evaluation criteria

**Step 2: Vendor Documentation Review**
```
Assessment Documentation:
├── SOC 2 Type II Reports (24 months)
├── Security Architecture Documentation  
├── Compliance Certifications (HIPAA, FedRAMP)
├── Incident Response Procedures
├── Business Continuity Plans
└── Sample Business Associate Agreement
```

**Step 3: Security Controls Evaluation**
```
Control Assessment Matrix:
                    Requirement  Vendor Score  Risk Level
Data Encryption     Required     ■■■■■         Low
Access Controls     Required     ■■■■□         Low  
Geo Residency      Required     ■■■■■         Low
Incident Response   Required     ■■■■□         Medium
Change Management   Required     ■■■□□         Medium
Disaster Recovery   Required     ■■■■■         Low
Compliance Program  Required     ■■■■■         Low
```

### After State - Risk Mitigation
**Vendor Security Posture:**
```
Final Risk Assessment:
├── Technical Controls: Strong (meets HIPAA standards)
├── Compliance Program: Comprehensive (clean audit history)  
├── Geographic Controls: Verified (US-only commitment)
├── Incident Response: Adequate (24-hour notification)
└── Contract Terms: Requires enhancement (security clauses)
```

**Risk Mitigation Strategy:**
```
Contract Security Requirements:
├── Specific encryption standards (AES-256, TLS 1.2+)
├── Geographic data residency guarantees
├── Incident notification timelines (24-hour maximum)
├── Audit and inspection rights
└── Security performance metrics and SLAs

Technical Implementation:
├── End-to-end encryption for all PHI transfers
├── Multi-factor authentication for all access
├── Comprehensive logging and monitoring
├── Regular security assessments and penetration testing
└── Business Associate Agreement execution
```

**Ongoing Risk Management:**
```
Vendor Oversight Program:
├── Quarterly security posture reviews
├── Annual third-party risk assessment updates
├── Continuous monitoring of vendor security incidents
├── Regular contract and SLA performance reviews
└── Incident response integration procedures
```

### Business Outcome
**Migration Enablement:**
- Provided clear vendor approval enabling 6-8 month migration timeline
- Identified and addressed critical security gaps before migration
- Established comprehensive vendor oversight framework

**Risk Reduction:**
- Confirmed HIPAA compliance capabilities and clean audit history
- Verified technical security controls meeting healthcare standards
- Established incident response integration reducing response time

**Regulatory Compliance:**

- Identified contract negotiation opportunities for enhanced security terms
- Established framework for future vendor assessments

**Deliverables:**
- Comprehensive vendor risk assessment report (25 pages)
- Security controls evaluation matrix with scoring
- Contract security requirements template
- Ongoing vendor monitoring framework
- Migration security implementation checklist
- Executive summary with go/no-go recommendation
