## Disclaimers

This is a personal project and does not represent or reflect the views, opinions, or work of my current or previous employers.

Case studies presented here use anonymized client information and focus on methodology and outcomes rather than proprietary details.


## Purpose

This portfolio is my initiative to showcase practical Governance, Risk, and Compliance work. It blends technical security practices with GRC frameworks, demonstrating how risk management and compliance can be applied in a way that supports business operations and security outcomes.

The portfolio is designed to:
- Showcase real-world GRC implementations with measurable business outcomes
- Bridge the gap between traditional compliance and technical automation
- Provide practical solutions for GRC professionals entering cloud security
- Document the journey from compliance analyst to GRC engineer


## About Me

I'm [Michael Nichols](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelnicholsprofile), a cybersecurity professional with 1.5+ years of experience in Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC), vulnerability management, audit readiness, and IAM.

- **Security Consulting**: Delivered SOC 2 readiness evaluations, HIPAA assessments, and third-party risk assessments for Fortune 500 companies and healthcare organizations. 
- **Governance & Risk**: Built NIST CSF maturity roadmaps, performed compliance gap analyses, and developed security control implementations across multiple frameworks.
- **Focus Areas**: AWS security foundations, risk management frameworks (NIST, ISO), vendor risk, and compliance automation.  

**Current Focus**: Developing GRC engineering capabilities through hands-on AWS security automation while maintaining deep expertise in traditional compliance frameworks.


## Career Transition Journey

### From International Business to GRC Engineering

My career transition journey has involved:

1. **Academic Foundation**: International Business & Finance degree providing global market perspective and analytical framework.
2. **Security Discovery**: Information Security internship at Ent Credit Union revealed passion for cybersecurity and introduction to GRC being the intersection of business and IT.
3. **Compliance Operations**: Data Compliance Analyst role managing regulatory requirements for 700+ energy operations with 100% compliance rate.
4. **GRC Specialization**: Cybersecurity consulting focused on SOC 2, HIPAA, and NIST CSF implementations for Fortune 500 clients.
5. **Technical Evolution**: Currently building GRC engineering capabilities through AWS security automation.

Key learnings include the critical need for GRC professionals to develop technical automation skills, the power of continuous monitoring over point-in-time assessments.

## Professional Case Studies

- [SOC 2 Readiness Evaluation](professional-case-studies/soc2-readiness-evaluation.md)  
  Comprehensive readiness assessment for Azure-hosted platform supporting Fortune 500 expansion timeline with Trust Service Criteria recommendations.
