## NIST CSF Maturity Assessment

### Business Context
**Client:** Web development company (25 employees, $2M revenue)
**Challenge:** Minimal cybersecurity program limiting growth opportunities
**Goal:** Advance from NIST CSF Tier 1 to Tier 2 to support SOC 2 readiness

### Before State - Tier 1 (Partial)
**Current Cybersecurity Maturity:**
```
NIST CSF Domain Assessment (Tier 1):
├── Identify: Asset Management          ■■□□□ (Limited inventory)
├── Identify: Risk Assessment           ■□□□□ (Reactive approach)
├── Protect: Access Control             ■■□□□ (Weak policies)
├── Protect: Data Security              ■■□□□ (Basic encryption)
├── Detect: Security Monitoring         ■□□□□ (Minimal detection)
├── Respond: Incident Response          ■□□□□ (No formal plan)
├── Recover: Recovery Planning          ■□□□□ (Limited procedures)
└── Govern: Risk Management             ■□□□□ (No formal program)
```

**Organizational Challenges:**
- No designated security personnel or formal program
- Ad-hoc, reactive security incident responses
- Staff sharing credentials and minimal security awareness
- Inconsistent security implementations across projects
- No third-party vendor risk assessment process

**Business Impact:**
- Unable to pursue enterprise clients requiring security certifications
- Potential regulatory compliance issues with client data
- Vulnerability to cyber threats without detection capabilities

### My Assessment Methodology
**Framework Applied:** NIST Cybersecurity Framework Current/Target Profile Analysis

**Step 1: Current State Documentation**
- Interviewed key stakeholders across 8 functional areas
- Documented existing security practices and gaps
- Assessed organizational risk tolerance and resources

**Step 2: Target State Design**
- Defined Tier 2 (Risk Informed) as achievable 12-month goal
- Aligned improvements with business growth objectives
- Prioritized domains supporting SOC 2 preparation

**Step 3: Gap Analysis & Roadmap Development**
```
Domain-by-Domain Gap Analysis:

Asset Management:
Current: Spreadsheet tracking, no configuration management
Target: Centralized CMDB with regular updates
Priority: High (Foundation for all other controls)

Risk Assessment:
Current: No formal risk assessment process  
Target: Annual risk assessments with documented mitigation
Priority: High (Required for Tier 2 classification)

Access Control:
Current: Shared accounts, no MFA, manual reviews
Target: Individual accounts, MFA, automated reviews  
Priority: Critical (Immediate security risk)

Data Protection:
Current: Basic encryption, no classification system
Target: Data classification with appropriate protections
Priority: Medium (Supports compliance requirements)
```

### After State - Tier 2 (Risk Informed)
**Target Cybersecurity Maturity:**
```
NIST CSF Domain Targets (Tier 2):
├── Identify: Asset Management          ■■■■□ (Comprehensive inventory)
├── Identify: Risk Assessment           ■■■■□ (Regular assessments)  
├── Protect: Access Control             ■■■■□ (Strong policies + MFA)
├── Protect: Data Security              ■■■■□ (Classification + encryption)
├── Detect: Security Monitoring         ■■■□□ (Basic monitoring deployed)
├── Respond: Incident Response          ■■■□□ (Formal plan + procedures)
├── Recover: Recovery Planning          ■■■□□ (Tested procedures)
└── Govern: Risk Management             ■■■■□ (Risk-informed decisions)
```

**Implementation Roadmap:**
```
Phase 1: Foundation (Months 1-3)
├── Hire/designate Information Security Officer
├── Implement comprehensive information security policy
├── Deploy MFA across all critical systems  
├── Conduct initial comprehensive risk assessment
└── Establish asset inventory and management system

Phase 2: Process Implementation (Months 4-6)
├── Establish risk management program with regular reviews
├── Implement formal change management procedures
├── Deploy data classification and handling policies  
├── Create incident response plan and train staff
└── Begin vendor risk assessment program

Phase 3: Advanced Capabilities (Months 7-12)
├── Implement security monitoring and alerting
├── Establish third-party risk management program
├── Begin SOC 2 compliance preparation activities
├── Conduct regular internal audits and assessments
└── Develop security metrics and reporting program
```

### Business Outcome
**Strategic Positioning:**
- Positioned for SOC 2 certification enabling enterprise sales
- Enhanced competitive advantage through demonstrated security maturity
- Foundation established for future compliance requirements

**Risk Management:**
- Transformed from reactive to proactive security posture
- Established formal risk assessment and mitigation processes
- Reduced cybersecurity risk exposure across all business operations

**Operational Benefits:**

- Systematic approach to security decision-making
- Improved client confidence through visible security improvements

**Growth Enablement:**
- Removed security barriers to enterprise client acquisition
- Established scalable security foundation supporting business growth
- Created pathway to additional certifications (ISO 27001, etc.)

**Deliverables:**
- NIST CSF Current and Target Profile documentation
- 8-domain gap analysis with prioritized remediation plan
- 12-month implementation roadmap with quarterly milestones
- Executive business case with ROI projections
- Security policy templates and procedure documentation
